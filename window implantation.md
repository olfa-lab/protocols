Protocol for Cranial Window Implantation

Setup:

1. Purchase 3 mm and 5 mm windows from Warner instruments (part number: 64-0726 (CS-3R-0))
2. Etch windows using modified etching protocol for coverslips (see other protocol)
3. Store in 70% ethanol in a glass beaker. It is important that you be able to pick up windows
using forceps from the beaker, so consider this when determining the beaker dimensions.
Alternatively, you can store the windows in individual 70% ethanol pipetted into eppendorf
tubes. This would reduce the impact of repeated contamination when you pull windows out of
the storage solution. 1-5 windows to a tube seems about right.
Craniotomy:
4. Plan your craniotomy by placing a non-etched (but clean!) window over your region of interest
on top of the skull. Draw a circle around the window using a fine sharpie marker and make sure
the edge of your circle is slightly bigger than the window. If the edge of the window fits perfectly
in the center of the line you have drawn you can be sure that the window will fit snuggly into the
craniotomy.
5. Using a small drill bit (¼?) with a mace-like tip (precise name?) drill the center of the line to
make a circle. Using light, pulsing movements, drill out the circle you have etched. If bleeding
from the bone occurs, drill at the source of the blood to remove the capillary and stop the
bleeding. Periodically wipe the bone dust away using a damp applicator.
6. Thin the skull around the circle until the skull disc is malleable. If the bone moves when you
touch it with forceps, you are almost through and don’t need to drill anymore. Focus drilling at
areas that are still rigid, or where you perceive the skull to be thick. BE EXTREMELY LIGHT
AND CAREFUL at this stage and remember that any pressure you apply could later contribute
to swelling of the brain. Keep the craniotomy clear of bone dust periodically using slightly dried
gel foam (applicators are too risky to use at this point).
7. Once a long region of the circle has been thinned it may pop up. So long as the rest of the
circle is thinned to the point of malleability, the skull flap is ready to be peeled off. Carefully grab
the edge of the skull flap with fine forceps and lift straight up. Try to avoid the skull flap pivoting
one edge into the brain, since this will cause bleeding/swelling.
8. As soon as the skull flap is removed, place clean gel foam on the brain to keep it moist. If the
brain looks splotchy, this could be small amounts of blood collected under the dura, which isn’t a
problem. You can clear this away by lightly gliding clean gel foam across the brain, pushing
these splotches away from the center of the craniotomy. Be careful not to leave gel foam on the
brain for more than a few minutes, as it will adhere to the dura. Alternatively, you can place gel
foam around the edges of the craniotomy to build a well, and fill this well with saline.

Window:

9. Position a manipulator arm and electrode holder to be centered over the craniotomy. Place a
long blunt or sharp needle in the electrode holder. This will be used to hold the window in place
while gluing. Remove any gel foam before continuing.
10. Clean forceps with ethanol and pull a window out of your vial/beaker. Dunk the window and
forceps into saline several times to remove the ethanol. Place the window gently onto the
craniotomy. Using closed, fine forceps, nudge the window into position within the craniotomy.
11. Lower the needle to press the window down to the level of the surrounding skull. This will
push the exposed brain back down to the level at which it began. You will notice the window
becoming more stable (not moving with breathing or table vibrations). Also, saline will be forced
out of the craniotomy.
12. Once the window is stable, dry the skull around the window using an applicator or a surgical
spear. The goal is to get the skull extremely dry while the saline under the window remains
intact. You have to do this quickly or the saline under the window will eventually leak out,
creating an air bubble. YOU DO NOT WANT ANY AIR BUBBLES UNDER THE WINDOW. This
is critical, since any air bubbles will lead to a cloudy window. If an air bubble forms, take a half-
soaked piece of gel foam and touch its corner to the edge of the window. The saline will run
under the window and force the bubbles out. However, you must then dry the top of the window
so that it will be a viable surface for gluing.
13. Once the skull is dry and window is bubble-free, quickly glue down the window. This is
performed by mixing Orthojet powder with Krazy glue in a dish until the mixture is slightly
viscous. Lift up a bead of the mixture with a 30g needle and glue around the edges of the
window. If the glue is the right consistency it will fill in the gap between the skull and window and
seal in the saline. The mixture turns clear when it is dry, which happens in ~5 minutes.
14. After the window is sealed in, remove the needle used for pressure and test the window by
pressing on it with a pointed object. It should be completely solid and you should see no liquid
movement under the glass. At the end of the surgery, use Metabond to cement the glue to the
skull, increasing the stability of the preparation.
