# Protocol: Cranial Window Etching with Modified Piranha Solution

Perform etching on many windows at once to minimize the amount of times this
needs to be performed (they can be stored in EtOH forever). However, you will
have to lift the windows one-by-one from one beaker into another, so donâ€™t use
too many that this would become tedious. ~100 should be fine.
The original protocol calls for h2o2 activated h2so4 in a ratio of (3:1). It a highly
exothermic reaction so has to be done under the hood with proper protection.
This must be left to cool down for several hours before adding a lot of water and
rinsing it down the sink.
However, it may be difficult to find h2so4 in a neuroscience lab, so HCL can also
be substituted. This will not cause an exothermic reaction, so the beaker can be
handled safely, though the efficacy of this method is still unknown. Many
protocols exist for etching coverslips, so a correct method is hard to determine
without some amount of trial and error. However, this method lead to greater
yield of clear cranial windows in our hands, so it is recommended. Essentially,
letting the windows sit in a strong acid, then rinsing them off and storing in EtOH
seems to be the consensus across labs (though heat may also be important).


*	Place windows into a small glass beaker.
*	Add 3ml 30% H2O2 and carefully shake so all windows are immersed 
*	Carefully and SLOWLY add 1ml concentrated HCL (hydrochloric acid) drop by drop. Shake beaker carefully when you are done to mix and immerse all windows.
*	When done, mix again, cover beaker with tin foil and let sit for several hours (4-16). Overnight should be fine. 
*	When complete, fish out the now clean windows with forceps and place them in a clean fresh beaker (autoclaved) with fresh ddH2O (at least 250 ml to make sure there is absolutely no HCL/H2O2 mixture remaining; this would etch away the brain!). To keep them as clean as they are, they should no longer be allowed to dry. 
*	Transfer the windows to a storage beaker/vial filled with 70% EtOH. To be sure they are properly rinsed, you can dunk them, one by one, into another beaker filled with fresh ddH2O, replacing the ddH2O after every few windows. (alternatively, you can dump the original beaker into a sterile (or extremely clean) stainless steel net with a fine mesh. You can then run the windows under a stream of ddH2O from the milipore machine to rinse them all at once. You can then dump them all into the storage beaker, or place them one by one, so long as they remain wet).
